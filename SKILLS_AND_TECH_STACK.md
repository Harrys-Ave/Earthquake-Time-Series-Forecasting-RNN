## Methodologies Applied
1. **Data Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL)**
   - Data sourced from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), filtered to include significant earthquakes (magnitude 5.5+) from 1900 to 2023.
   - Data cleaning involved removing early records with technological limitations, addressing outliers, and mapping events to countries and tectonic plates using GeoJSON files.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Log transformations and upper clipping applied to features with skewed distributions.
   - Interquartile Range (IQR) analysis used for outlier detection.
   - kNN imputation for maintaining time series continuity, especially with missing values in temporal sequences.
   - Haversine formula for spatial distance calculations to enhance geographic accuracy.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Introduction of cyclic features (e.g., day of the week with sine and cosine transformations).
   - Statistical features such as Mean Magnitude, Magnitude Difference, and earthquake counts per country.
   - Semivariogram Analysis for spatial feature engineering, capturing spatial correlations across geographic distances.

4. **Data Splitting**
   - Temporal split strategy for train, validation, and test sets, reflecting realistic conditions for time series data.
   - Split configuration: 60% training, 20% validation, and 20% test.

5. **Time Series Modeling**
   - ARIMA Model as a statistical baseline for performance comparison.
   - LSTM-Based Models: Designed various LSTM-based models, including enhancements with Semivariogram Analysis and Attention Mechanisms for improved spatial and temporal correlation capture.
