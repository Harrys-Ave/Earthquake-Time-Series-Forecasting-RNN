# Forecasting-Earthquakes
This thesis addresses the problem of forecasting significant global earthquakes (magnitude 5.5+) using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and semivariogram analysis.

1) All the graphs that have to do with the EDA and the results of the EDA are on the Jupyter notebook with the name EDA_1_LSTM_baseline_model
2) The file EDA_1_model_ARIMA is a simple statistical baseline model so we can compare our sophisticated deep learning approach to it.
3) The best performed model is on the Jupyter notebook with the name EDA_2_baseline_plus_semivariogram_model.ipynb
4) The mapping of earthquakes with Countries is made in the file Mapping of earthquakes with countries.ipynb. After that we saved the new dataset and continued our analysis on the other files. The reason was that the mapping of each earthquake with a country actually was time consuming and we did not want to waste time in each experimentation of our models.
