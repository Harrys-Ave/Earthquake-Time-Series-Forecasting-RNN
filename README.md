# Forecasting-Earthquakes
This thesis addresses the problem of forecasting significant global earthquakes (magnitude 5.5+) using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and semivariogram analysis.

All the graphs that have to do with the EDA and the results of the EDA are on the Jupyter notebook with the name EDA_1_baseline_model.ipynb
The best performed model is on the Jupyter notebook with the name EDA_2_baseline_semivariogram_model.ipynb
